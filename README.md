# Data-Analytics-Group-1-Diamonds
For this group project, the objective was to analyze data regarding diamonds and look for patterns, utilizing charts and graphs.

For my portion of the project, I looked at the correlation between the quality of the diamond and price using a violin plot, and found that for the most part, the quality of the diamond did not impact price (little correlation). However, diamonds classified as "fair" had a greater distribution of price than the other qualities, specifically higher prices.

Other group members took a look at the correlation between price and carat using a scatter plot (found positive correlation), the correlation between carat and quality using a violin plot (little correlation), and the corrleation between price and clarity. I1, SI1, SI2, VS1 and VS2 had the greater distribution of price, specifically higher prices. This was surprising for the following reasons (although it should be noted that the maximum price was around 20,000 and that makes it more challenging to see differences at the lower end of the price range):

I1 diamonds have inclusions that affect beauty and are deemed undesirable, and although SI1 and SI2 have fewer inclusions which are deemed undesirable, they too were often priced highly. VS1 and VS2 have significantly fewer inclusions, so they are deemed more desirable than I1, SI1, and SI2. Despite this, all 4 are in similar price ranges.

Most surprising was that IF diamonds, which have no inclusions and are therefore considered more visually appealing, were still priced lower than I1, SI1, SI2, VS1, and VS2, which have varying degrees of inclusion and are considered less visually appealing.
